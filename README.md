# ScientiaMobile AngularJS Practical Tests

There are two AngularJS practical tests included in this repository.

Both use [Laravel 5.3](https://laravel.com/docs/5.3) for their back-end, however, knowledge of Laravel is not required. All necessary back-end components have been set up as needed for each exercise.

Specific instructions are included in each exercise.

Setup is required prior to attempting these exercises.

### Installation
